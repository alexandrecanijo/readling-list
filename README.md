# Random Links for reading
This is a list of random links stored from several sites for reading purposes.
They might be useful or not - but I want to store them somewhere and read them along the way.
Maybe some of them will be useful to you too.

Enjoy.

**Note:**
The links are collected by this chrome extension created by [Idnan](https://github.com/Idnan)
